My Favorite editor is Visual Studios Code, it is my favorite because you can pretty much use it for any language because it is open source and people are constantly putting out new plugins for it. I also like it because it has auto-complete, I find that to be very helpful because it saves time and gets you familiar with the syntax of the language. Lastly, it is very easy to navigate and use visual studios' code.

touch a.txt

touch b.txt

touch a.bak

touch b.bak

-----------------------------

for files in ' ls *.txt '

do

mv -- $file new_$file

done

-----------------------------
for bakfile in ' ls *.bak '

do

if [ -f $bakfile ]
then

rm $ bakfile

done

-----------------------------

for pyfile in ' ls *.py '
do

if [ wc -l $pyfile -gt 10]
then 

mv -- $pyfile long_$pyfile
else

mv -- $pyfile short_$pyfile
